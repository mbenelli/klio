    <h1>Klio</h1>

    <p>Klio is a collection of open-source, production-quality tools for
      the Gambit-C Scheme system.  Its development is driven from
      real-world requests in the field of industrial automation, and
      powered by state of the art researchs in information technology.</p>

    <p>A <a href="els2012-klio-paper.pdf">paper</a> involving the use of
      Klio has been <a href="els2012-klio-presentation.pdf">presented</a>
      at the <a href="http://european-lisp-symposium.org">5th European Lisp
	Symposium</a>.

    <h2>Klio Libraries </h2>
    <p>Utilities for day by day development: data structures, regular
      expressions, date and time processing, xml parsing and authoring,
      json conversion, database access and so on.  Most of these libraries
      come from careful design and extensive real-world testing.
      A continuous effort is spent in tuning their performance and
      usability.</p>

    <h2>Klio Web Server</h2>
    <p>A powerful and fast web server, it offers the flexibily of
      dynamical languages and the performance of compiled ones.  It is
      used in several production environments on a variety of
      architectures, as a key element in critical application on systems
      with constrainted resources.</p>

    <h2>Klio SCADA</h2>
    <p>Interfaces with PLCs using standards protocols like modbus or
      fetchwrite, taking advantage of meta-programming facilities for
      generate configurations and addresses mapping from a variety of
      specification sources.</p>

    <h2>Klio AI</h2>
    <p>Work in progress on simple and powerful synergy between classical
      AI tools (searching, plannig) and statistical and signal processing
      algorithim</p>
