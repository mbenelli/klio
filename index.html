      <h1>Klio</h1>

	  <p>Klio is a collection of open-source, production-quality tools for
	  the Gambit-C Scheme system.  Its development is driven from
	  real-world requests in the field of industrial automation, and
	  powered by state of the art researchs in information technology.</p>

	  <p>A report involving the use of Klio has been presented at the
	  <a href="http://european-lisp-symposium.org">5th European Lisp
	  Symposium</a>. The paper can be downloaded  <a
	  href="els2012-klio-paper.pdf">here</a> and the slides are
	  <a href="els2012-klio-presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	
	  <p>Klio is released under LGPL license.  The code can be found at:
	  <a href="https://github.com/mbenelli/klio">
	  </a></p>


	  <h2>Platforms</h2>
	  <p>Klio has been used and tested on following platforms:</p>
	  <ul>
            <li>x86-64 - OpenBSD</li>
	    <li>x86    - FreeBSD</li>
            <li>x86-64 - GNU/Linux</li>
	    <li>x86    - GNU/Linux</li>
	    <li>ARM    - GNU/Linux</li>
	    <li>SH2    - ucLinux</li>
	    <li>x86-64 - MS Windows</li>
	    <li>x86-64 - Mac OS X</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Many thanks to Marina Pettinari and Andrea Baldini for their
	  help in porting on SH-2/ucLinux.</p>

	  <h2>Klio Libraries </h2>
	  <p>Utilities for day by day development: data structures, regular
	  expressions, date and time processing, xml parsing and authoring,
	  json conversion, database access and so on.  Most of these libraries
	  come from careful design and extensive real-world testing.
	  A continuous effort is spent in tuning their performance and
	  usability.</p>

	  <h2>Klio Web Server</h2>
	  <p>A powerful and fast web server, it offers the flexibily of
	  dynamical languages and the performance of compiled ones.  It is
	  used in several production environments on a variety of
	  architectures, as a key element in critical application on systems
	  with constrainted resources.</p>

	  <h2>Klio SCADA</h2>
	  <p>Interfaces with PLCs using standards protocols like modbus or
	  fetchwrite, taking advantage of meta-programming facilities for
	  generate configurations and addresses mapping from a variety of
	  specification sources.</p>

	  <h2>Klio AI</h2>
	  <p>Work in progress on simple and powerful synergy between classical
	  AI tools (searching, plannig) and statistical and signal processing
	  algorithim</p>
