KLIO                                                          -*- outline -*-


* Description

A collection of scheme tools and libraries for gambit scheme.
Main components are:

. klio-lib : libraries
. klio-ws  : web-server


** Klio-lib

Klio lib is a collection of standard scheme libraries gathered from the net.
The libraries has been modified and reorganized to fit my way of working
with gambit.
If you're looking for gambit's libraries probably blackhole or snow will fit
your needs better than klio.
The distinctive "features" of klio are:

- vs blackhole: Klio doesn't use hygienic macros, only gambit's
  define-macro
- vs snow: Klio doesn't require installation of any tool, and doesn't try to
  be portable between implementations.


** Klio-ws

Klio web server is a simple but powerful web-server.
It's main goals are:

- portability
- reliable ad efficient implementation of HTTP 1.1
- integraton with ssax-sxml for dinamic pages
- good performance for small sites (few users) with heavy load (pages refreshed
  periodically)



* Installation


** klio-libs

Running:

$ gsc -i build.scm

from Klio's directory will build klio-lib.
If you want to include/exclude some libs you must edit this file.


** klio-ws

Run:

$ gsc -exe lib/kws-script.scm

will build an executable file in "lib" directory.
The exectubable is named "kws-script" or "kws-script.exe" depending on you OS.
You can change the name of resulting executable with -o option, see gambit's
documentation.



* Usage


** klio-libs

There is no search path, or autoloading or similar.
The preferred way for developing with klio is the C-like way allowed by
gambit's include and namespace.
Be aware that some "header" file (those whose name end with "#") contains
also macro definition.

For those who like "batteries-included" philosophy it should be possible to
compile all files in a single loadable object, the load it at gambit's startup
using .gambcini or gambcext (see gambit's documentation).
Be aware that header files must be included.


** klio-ws

Run:

$ ./klio-script <port number> <server-root-directory>

If unspecified, server-root-directory will default to corrent directory,
and port number to 8000.
